	    <h2>God's Love</h2>
		<p>God loves us so much that he sent his only son down to Earth to die for us.
		   It's an important fact that is often taken for granted. Sometimes we may want
		   to rebel agaisnt God because life isn't going our way, but it is important to
		   remember his love for us. He wants what is best for us even if it is not
		   what we are hoping for. He blesses us this way.</p>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Scriptures about his love for us:</p>
		 <ul>
		   <li ><a class="smallLi" target="_blank" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/deut/7.8?lang=eng#p7">
			 Deuteronomy 7:8</a></li>
		   <li ><a class="smallLi" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/31.23?lang=eng#p22">
			 Psalms 31:23</a></li>
		   <li ><a class="smallLi" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/3.16?lang=eng#p15">
			 John 3:16</a></li>
		 </ul>

	  <div id="div2" class="panel">
	  	    <h2>Second Coming</h2>
		<p>The second coming is an interesting and mysterious topic. Endless generations have
		tried to predict when it will happen. Others have tried to predict how it will happen.
		No one knows for sure the details of the second coming. What we do know is that we
		should prepare ourselves for when it does happen. By making ourselves worthy and 
	    devoting our lives to God, we will not be caught off guard. Some think that they can do what they 
		want and then repent at the last second. Unfortunately, since we don't know when the
		time will be, this would not be a wise choice. Being prepared to be reunited with
		our Heavenly Father is the only way to be sure he will accept us into his kingdom.</p>

		 <p>Scriptures about the second coming:</p>
		 <ul>
		   <li ><a class="smallLi" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/16.27?lang=eng#p26">
			 Matthew 16:27</a></li>
		   <li ><a class="smallLi" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/1.7?lang=eng#p6">
			 Revelation 1:7</a></li>
		   <li ><a class="smallLi" href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/25.1-13">
			 Matthew 25:1-13</a></li>

	  	  	    <h2>Forgiveness</h2>
		<p>Forgiving others is not an easy thing to do. we often get caught up on 
		the actions of others that we forget about the bigger picture. Holding grudges 
		towards those who have hurt us is not only useless, but it can stop us from 
		moving on and growing as children of God. The second commandment says, "Thou 
		shall love thy neighbor". I believe a huge part of showing love for our neighbors 
		includes offering forgiveness. God forgives us when we do him wrong so it is best 
		to follow his example forgive as well. </p>
