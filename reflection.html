	  <p>
	    My project has pretty much stayed the same as my reflection. I think it came out
		even better than I first imagined. There were some things I did not have a chance
		to do because I was running out of time. I would say spent about 8 hours or more
		working on this website. If I had more time I would have liked to make a page where
		people can submit spiritual thoughts. Unfortunately I dont know how to do that so 
		I did not have enough time to learn. The strengths of my project are definitely 
		the website. I think it is aesthetically pleasing and has cool functionality. 
        I had to do some research on the topics I chose to talk about and I think that
        helped expand my knowledge for our savior's love for us. It would also help others
        that may be unfamiliar with the topics. I added additional scriptures in case they
        want to study it further. I would not change anything if I retook this course.
        I really enjoyed it and the final project was fun because I was able to do something
        that I enjoy. This course has strengthened my testimony because I have learned
        a lot of new things. We have gone deeper into topics than I had before. I enjoyed 
        learning about other people's perspectives on some things. I will remember the 
        stuff that Sis. Waldron has taught me and apply them to my everyday life. Learning
        is one thing, but actually implementing it into our lives adds a whole new perspective.
